/* Uthreads blocking on event queues
 *
 * It'd be nice to have a uthread sleep until an event queue has some activity
 * (e.g. a new message).  It'd also be nice to wake up early with a timer.  It
 * is tempting to try something like an INDIR and have one evq multiplex two
 * others (the real event and an alarm).  But then you can't separate the two
 * streams; what if one thread sleeps on just the event at the same time?  What
 * if we want to support something like Go's select: a thread wants to block
 * until there is some activity on some channel?
 *
 * Ultimately, we want to allow M uthreads to block on possibly different
 * subsets of N event queues.
 *
 * Every uthread will have a sleep controller, and every event queue will have a
 * wakeup controller.  There are up to MxN linkage structures connecting these.
 *
 * We'll use the event_queue handler to override the default event processing.
 * This means the event queues that are used for blocking uthreads can *only* be
 * used for that; the regular event processing will not happen.  This is mostly
 * true.  It is possible to extract events from an evq's mbox concurrently.
 *
 * I briefly considered having one global lock to protect all of the lists and
 * structures.  That's lousy for the obvious scalability reason, but it seemed
 * like it'd make things easier, especially when I thought I needed locks in
 * both the ectlr and the uctlr (in early versions, I considered having the
 * handler yank itself out of the ectlr, copying a message into that struct, or
 * o/w needing protection).  On occasion, we run into the "I'd like to split my
 * lock between two components and still somehow synchronize" issue (e.g. FD
 * taps, with the FDT lock and the blocking/whatever that goes on in a device).
 * Whenever that comes up, we usually can get some help from other shared memory
 * techniques.  For FD taps, it's the kref.  For us, it's post-and-poke, though
 * it didn't solve all of our problems - I use it as a tool with some basic
 * shared memory signalling. */
